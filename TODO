[01:04, 12/23/2019] Moritz: Maybe optimize service worker by storing build pages in cache. But then you need to care about updates. First, use browser tools to measure performance
[01:07, 12/23/2019] Moritz: Maybe use json format or so and update fewer parts of the page
[01:07, 12/23/2019] Moritz: Maybe pushstate can do it almost without service worker?
[01:07, 12/23/2019] Moritz: Push state go to top of page
[01:08, 12/23/2019] Moritz: And remember old positions
[01:08, 12/23/2019] Moritz: Maybe even remember old content so you don't need to refetch it
[01:11, 12/23/2019] Moritz: minimal-ui isn't really needed on phones except for sharing and maybe going forward and refreshing as the back button also works

[02:40, 12/23/2019] Moritz: Service worker install store image, CSS, index , sw.js, manifest
[02:41, 12/23/2019] Moritz: Maybe push almost everything
[02:44, 12/23/2019] Moritz: Webpagespeed.org downloads sw.is twice and uses two connections?
[02:52, 12/23/2019] Moritz: Defer JavaScript for higher performance?
[02:53, 12/23/2019] Moritz: Brotli?
[02:53, 12/23/2019] Moritz: Other webserver?
[02:53, 12/23/2019] Moritz: Http3?
[02:53, 12/23/2019] Moritz: Custom web server? Keep everything in memory?
[03:19, 12/23/2019] Moritz: Use tools to measure performance
[03:19, 12/23/2019] Moritz: Optimize CSS: grid?, will-change, contain, transform, ...
[12:10, 12/23/2019] Moritz: If no network connection show better error message. If connected again (event), auto refresj
[13:20, 12/23/2019] Moritz: Short name AfF
