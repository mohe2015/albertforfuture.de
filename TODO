Maybe optimize service worker by storing build pages in cache. But then you need to care about updates. First, use browser tools to measure performance
Maybe use json format or so and update fewer parts of the page
Maybe pushstate can do it almost without service worker?
Push state go to top of page
And remember old positions
Maybe even remember old content so you don't need to refetch it
minimal-ui isn't really needed on phones except for sharing and maybe going forward and refreshing as the back button also works
Preload image
Service worker install store image, CSS, index , sw.js, manifest
Maybe push almost everything
Webpagespeed.org downloads sw.is twice and uses two connections?
Defer JavaScript for higher performance?
Brotli?
Other webserver?
Http3?
Custom web server? Keep everything in memory?
Use tools to measure performance
Optimize CSS: grid?, will-change, contain, transform, ...
If no network connection show better error message. If connected again (event), auto refresj
