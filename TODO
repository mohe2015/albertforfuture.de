Maybe use json format or so and update fewer parts of the page
Maybe pushstate can do it almost without service worker?

Push state go to top of page
And remember old positions
Maybe even remember old content so you don't need to refetch it

minimal-ui isn't really needed on phones except for sharing and maybe going forward and refreshing as the back button also works

Service worker install store image, CSS, index , sw.js, manifest
Maybe push almost everything

Defer JavaScript for higher performance?
Brotli?
Other webserver?
