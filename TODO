nginx config /sw.js and push urls

without service worker and without history api:
+every page gets cached for n hours
+pages get loaded by browser

without service worker and with history api:
+every page gets loaded by js, otherwise same

with service worker and without history api:
service worker fetches pages and caches them forever using an etag database
if serviceworker gets updated it gets a new database and provides new files
service worker is cached for like a few hours
TODO use /raw links without the script and link tags as a new script or stylesheet would invalidate all other pages
TODO or don't use /raw links and the service worker just updates index.html (its shell) and replaces the shell on all other pages. -> good idea

with service worker and with history api:
same but it doesn't need a full refresh

TODO service worker search?

TODO delete outdated chaches
