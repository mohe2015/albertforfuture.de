TODO notify user if available offline

TODO broadcast updates to pages

TODO push notifications for new articles
TODO notification bell not in dropdown

TODO service worker search?

Maybe use json format or so and update fewer parts of the page

minimal-ui isn't really needed on phones except for sharing and maybe going forward and refreshing as the back button also works

If no network connection show better error message. If connected again (event), auto refresh

TODO mobile first css

History API disabled as the scrolling is REALLY buggy and it's probably not really worth it
