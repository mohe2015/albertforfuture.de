maybe make navbar able to open without javascript?

TODO push notifications for new articles
TODO notification bell



NEW approach:

no service worker: just load the page maybe get a 403 (with like 1 hour cache time or more), resources with hash infinite
with service worker: download all pages, just redownload all of them if cache timeout - no special handling


MAYBE dont use pushstate because it is buggy
