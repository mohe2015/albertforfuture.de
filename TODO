FIXME BLOCKING: henne ei problem - index.js updates pages that include old index.js
SIMPLEFIX: JUST let service worker download all articles (BAD SOLUTION)
OTHERFIX: ALSO CACHE index.js and also update it on service worker update: GOOD IDEA as we are offline anyways so this shouldn't hurt that much

no service worker: just load the page maybe get a 304 not modified (with like 1 hour cache time or more), resources with hash infinite

with service worker: download all pages, just redownload all of them if cache timeout - no special handling
TODO later optimize that it creates diff and only updates necessary pages (using file hash if possible?, by storing etag responses?)
