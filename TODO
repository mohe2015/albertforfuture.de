without service worker and without history api:
+every page gets cached for n hours
+pages get loaded by browser

without service worker and with history api:
every page gets loaded by js, otherwise same

with service worker and without history api:
service worker fetches pages and caches them forever using an etag database
if serviceworker gets updated it gets a new database and provides new files
service worker is cached for like a few hours
downloads pages in background (as there are currently only a few)

with service worker and with history api:
same but it doesn't need a full refresh


TODO service worker search?


TODO delete outdated chaches


TODO use /raw links without the script and link tags as a new script or stylesheet would invalidate all other pages
TODO or don't use raw links and the service worker just updates index.html (its shell) and replaces the shell on all other pages. -> good idea

TODO check if BROWSER cache contains a normal url if possible
TODO then the navbar needs to be updated client side
